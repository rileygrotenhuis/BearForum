# Bear Forum

Bear Forum is a CRUD forum web application built using the Node and Express Javascript frameworks. Users can create an account and login to view posts from other users as well as create, update, and delete any of their own posts. There is also an admin portal for this forum which allows an admin to update or delete any post or user that they want.

## Requirements

---

You will need the latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to run BearBank correctly. To check whether you have the correct versions, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
 ```

```bash
 npm-v
```

## Setup

---

You can utilize this repository by one of the two ways:

1. Downloading the source code directly from this [link](https://github.com/rileygrotenhuis/BearBank)

2. Cloning the repository using your preferred Command Line Interface and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rileygrotenhuis/BearBank.git
```

> Note: Whether you choose to download, or clone, this repository, it is preferred that you do so inside of your `documents/` directory.

> Note: If you download the code directly from GitHub into a `.zip` file, you will need to rename the folder from `BearBank-master` to just `BearBank`.

## Usage

---

1. Open your preferred Command Line Interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, iTask2, PowerShell, etc.) and change your directory until you are in the project folder

```bash
cd documents
cd BearBank
```

2. At this point, you can now run the following commands in your Command Line Interface to run the BearBank application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Note: Once you run this application, you can access it at http://localhost:3000/

## Notes

---

This project currently does not have a list site to where you can test it. I am hoping to change this in the future as I am hoping to include a testing site for all of my personal projects that will be connected to my Personal Portfolio Website, but as of now you must run this project locally.
